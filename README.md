# JustACourierApp

JustACourierApp is an example project to demonstrate the skills I've learned working with multiple teams as an iOS Engineer.

## Project Focus

- **Dependency Injection**
- **Navigation with Coordinator**
- **SwiftUI** (custom styles, modifiers)
- **Clean Architecture** (presentation, domain, data, and app layer folders)
- **CI with GitHub Actions** (jobs for unit tests, UI tests, and Swiftlint linter)
- **UI Automation with XCUITest** (using POM Pattern)
- **Unit Tests with Doubles**
- **Dependency Management with SPM** (I'm a little tired of using **Cocoapods** ðŸ˜ƒ)

## Features

1. **Dependency Injection**: Implements a flexible and testable architecture with containers (currently one container).
2. **Navigation Coordinator**: Manages navigation flow in a clean and organized way.
3. **SwiftUI**: Utilizes custom styles and modifiers for a modern UI.
4. **Clean Architecture**: Separates the project into presentation, domain, data, and app layers. The next step is to create different repositories for each layer.
5. **Continuous Integration**: Uses GitHub Actions to automate unit tests, UI tests, and Swiftlint checks.
6. **UI Automation**: Employs XCUITest with the Page Object Model (POM) pattern for robust UI testing.
7. **Unit Tests**: Includes unit tests with doubles for thorough testing coverage.

## Getting Started
